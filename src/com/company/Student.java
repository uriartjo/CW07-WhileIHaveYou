        So between us, Mr. U absolutely hates odd numbers. His life is one of tragedy and sorrow, all due to
        even numbers. How? Man, I don't know...I'm just a guy trying to make programming problems that don't make you
        want to fall asleep.

        Okay fine, cause 7 8 my entire family. Get it?

        .....

        Anyways - this method works in one of two ways.

        IF the boolean is set to true, then it should loop from 0 to numToStopAt and when, and only when, the number
        is confirmed as even should it be output through System.out.println.

        IF the boolean is set to false, then you should skip over the odd numbers within the for loop itself.

        Boom, I just made you do two different for loop problems in one. You're welcome.
